# even_checker_with_random
Function that checks for even or odd numbers
As part of WeCloudData Python Course, this is a code that randomly generates 2 numbers and checks for even and odd. If both numbers are even, then the lesser number is returned. If there is an odd number than the greater of the two numbers is returned.
**Code works but there is a bug with the output
